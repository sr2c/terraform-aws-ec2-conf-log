Terraform module to deploy a pair of S3 buckets, one for configuration and one for logging, along with the necessary
IAM role and instance profile to allow for EC2 instances to interact with the buckets. The instance profile will also
include the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy to allow the use of SSM.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


### Simple Example

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

module "ec2_conf_log" {
  source = "./.."
  namespace = "eg"
  name = "ecl"
}

data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {
  state = "available"
}

data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

data "aws_subnet" "default" {
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0]
  default_for_az = true
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

module "instance" {
  source                      = "cloudposse/ec2-instance/aws"
  version                     = "0.45.0"

  subnet                      = data.aws_subnet.default.id
  vpc_id                      = data.aws_vpc.default.id
  ami                         = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  ami_owner                   = "099720109477"
  assign_eip_address          = true
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  disable_api_termination     = false
  instance_type               = "t3.medium"
  instance_profile            = module.ec2_conf_log.instance_profile_name

  namespace = "eg"
  name = "ecl"
}
```

### Perform configuration

While this module does not prescribe a particular way of configuring the instances, one approach is to use a
cron job to regularly update the instance from the S3 bucket. It is important here to consider race conditions
where only part of an update has been pushed to the S3 bucket but not all objects are there yet. It may make
sense to upload an archive to S3 and download that as a single object rather than uploading multiple objects.

Example crontab:

```crontab
*/2 * * * * root /bin/bash /root/configure.sh &>/dev/null
```

Example configurations script:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

aws s3 cp s3://example-bucket-name/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

systemctl reload-or-restart nginx
```

The bucket name can be templated at instance creation time, with the crontab and script installed via cloud-init.

### logrotate

While this module does not prescribe a particular way of submitting logs from the instance to the logs bucket,
one method is to use logrotate. The following example works on an Ubuntu instance to rotate all the logs in an
EOTK project and upload only the nginx access logs to the logs bucket (excluding error logs and others):

```logrotate
/home/ubuntu/eotk/projects.d/sites.d/log.d/*.log {
  su ubuntu ubuntu
  create 644 ubuntu ubuntu
  hourly
  dateext
  # 1 week. 1 rotation per hour = 168 hours/rotations per week
  rotate 168
  missingok
  ifempty
  compress
  lastaction
    # run once after all files are rotated
    ROTATED_DIR="$(dirname "$1")"
    INCLUDE_PATTERN="nginx-access*.log-*.gz"
    BUCKET_NAME="example-bucket-name"

    TOKEN=`/usr/bin/curl --silent --request PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" --header "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 60"`
    REGION=`/usr/bin/curl --silent --header "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | grep region | cut -d\" -f4`
    INSTANCE_ID=`/usr/bin/curl --silent --header "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | grep instanceId | cut -d\" -f4`

    /usr/bin/aws s3 sync "$ROTATED_DIR/" "s3://$BUCKET_NAME/$INSTANCE_ID/" --region $REGION --exclude "*" --include "$INCLUDE_PATTERN" --quiet

    /home/ubuntu/eotk/eotk --local nxreload -a
    /home/ubuntu/eotk/eotk --local torreload -a
  endscript
}
```

The bucket name can be templated at instance creation time, with the logrotate package and script installed via
cloud-init.

## Trans Rights

![Trans Rights Are Human Rights][trans_rights]

Trans is an umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the
sex they were assigned at birth. *Like all people*, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to
have their human rights protected.

Trans people face significant discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives, including employment,
education, housing, and healthcare. They are also at increased risk of violence and hate crimes. These issues
can have a serious impact on the physical and mental well-being of trans people and can prevent them from fully
participating in society.

Trans rights are therefore an important part of the broader struggle for human rights. Everyone, regardless of
their gender identity, should be able to live their lives free from discrimination and to enjoy the same rights and
opportunities as everyone else. This includes the right to express their gender identity and to be treated with respect
and dignity.

It is important for society to recognize and respect the rights of trans people, and to take steps to address the
discrimination and prejudice that they face. This can include supporting policies and laws that protect trans
people from discrimination and promoting acceptance and understanding of trans people within the broader
community.

* [Four Pillars'](https://www.fourpillarsuk.org/) mission is to support the LGBT+ community in manners of Mental,
  Emotional, Physical & Sexual Health and offer information & support on a person-to-person basis to build a community
  that supports itself through peer education; thereby allowing individuals to make informed choices to improve their
  overall health & wellbeing.

* [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) is a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation
  with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community
  knowledge. They offer staff training, consultancy, youth work, mentoring and undertake public engagement activities.
